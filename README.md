# Academic project completed in Fall 2023

## Project Title: Footwear Distro
Team members: Tony C, Jacky K

Footwear Distro is a chain of shoe stores with its own distribution centers. Our company has 3 distribution centers,
one located on the west coast, one located in the south, and another on the east coast, and 13 stores across the country.
Each store specializes in a specific type of footwear, luxury, casual, athletic, and discount. The store can expect
to receive products from the distribution centers only, not other stores.

This repository contains my independent copy of a collaborative academic project completed as part of the
Computer Science program.

## Key Features
Product Management:
Track product details (type, SKU, description, category: luxury, casual, athletic, discount).
Manage inventory levels at each distribution center.

Distribution Center Management:
Store information about each distribution center (location, capacity, current inventory).

Store Management:
Store details (location, specialization, population size, inventory received).

Inventory Transfer Tracking:
Record transfers from distribution centers to stores.
Track quantity, source, destination, and date of each transfer.

Demand Allocation:
Allocate inventory to stores based on population/location (e.g., large cities get more units).

Reporting & Analytics:
Generate reports on inventory levels, transfers, and store allocations.
Monitor stock levels to prevent shortages or overstock.

Audit & History:
Track changes to inventory and transfers for accountability.

These features will help you manage and optimize the distribution of footwear across your network.

## Collaborators

This is the home page of the application.

**[Figure 2. Distribution Centers Page](docs/screenshots/2_distribution_centers_page.jpg)**  
Users can **ADD**, **UPDATE**, and **DELETE** entries for Distribution Centers. Records are displayed in a table pulled from the database.

**[Figure 3. Inventories Page](docs/screenshots/3_inventories_page.jpg)**  
Manages Inventories â€” the intersection of Distribution Centers and Products. Deleting a related entry cascades deletion. Full CRUD supported.

**[Figure 4. Products Page](docs/screenshots/4_products_page.jpg)**  
Supports **SEARCH**, **ADD**, **UPDATE**, and **DELETE**. Nullable relationships with Models and Colors. Includes search filtering by dropdown.

**[Figure 5. Models Page](docs/screenshots/5_models_page.jpg)**  
Displays model data with full CRUD support. Data is shown in a database-driven table.

**[Figure 6. Colors Page](docs/screenshots/6_colors_page.jpg)**  
Users can add, update, and delete color entries. Data is listed from the database.
